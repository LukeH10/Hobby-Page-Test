        <h2>About Me and my Hobby</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Luke Huyett and I've always loved basketball. Every since I was little I would play and watch basketball with my brother. This provided great bonding experiences with him and brought us closer together. I was never really that good at basketball until I was in highschool because that is when I practiced every day and played for the school team.

        <p>
            My favorite basketball team is the Oklahoma City Thunder. I admire them because throughout the years, they have had such an amazing and versitile roster that two of my favorite players were on at some point. Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant are two of my favorite players in the NBA right now. Westbrook is insperational to me because he shows that even if you are small, you can still be a force to be reckoned with. Durant has always been an amazing player to watch as he is very smooth with his game and crafty, almost everything he does is with finesse.

        <h2>Skills and Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            I tend to get a lot of my points in the paint. As a bigger guy, I had to develope a sense for the post. The post is where I do my best work and I take inspiration from Durant for my favorite move to do which is a post fade. I pump-fake my defender with my right hand and side whilst planting my right foot firmly away from them and spinning clockwise off of that foot while using my momentum to lead my shot into a fadeaway which is really hard to block. I would usually practice this move a lot before my games and even try it on the opposite side to get more comfortable with my left hand.

        <h2>Favorite Basketball Gear</h2>
        <p>
            As for my favorite gear, I always wear a short sleeved compression shirt under my jersey which would help keep me warm in the begining of the game and cool towards the end. I would also wear short compression shorts under my game shorts which would help reduce chafing on my thighs from the seams in the game shorts. Lastly, my favorite basketball shoes of all time... The Kyrie 5. I had a tendency when I was younger to roll my ankles a lot and sprain them. Low top shoes made me feel unsafe and unsecure while high top shoes were uncomfortable and hurt me when running, but the Kyrie 5 had the perfect mid top which made me feel secure while also having soles that rolled over the edges of the shoe to allow the wearer to transition from running or standing still to quickly cutting to the basket without te risk of rolling their ankle.
